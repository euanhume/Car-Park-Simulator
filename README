This is my first project I have uploaded.
This is a car park simulation program, designed to show our skills in Object Orientated Programming. It was created to the specification (included) for my module "Object Orientated Analysis, Design and Implementation" during my second year at Sheffielld Hallam University studying towards an MComp in Computing and Information Systems. It was implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional and Rational Rose due to the preferences of my Lecturer.
